        <p>The Questboard project is our group's final output for our Software Tools and Development Frameworks class. This uses Django as the back-end and front-end of the website. The main function of the website is to act like a general questboard where the students can see the quests that they can take on. However, there must be an option to have different questboards per group of students and these questboards can have their own set of quest cards that the professor will create. Within each questboard, the instructor must have the option to edit the details about the questboard but there must also be a student view where the edit options are not available. This was done using student links which will redirect the page to the questboard's student view.  </p>

        <h3 class="project-heading">Project Highlights</h3>
        <p>In this project, we get to implement databases to store the information about the questboards and quest cards. We used Django models to manipulate our data and although it was a new experience for us, it was very important in our understanding of website backends. Also, with projects like this, especially the ones done during the quarantine periods, it was a lot harder to ask for help and feedback from our professors. So for most of this project's development period, we had to rely on ourselves to debug our code and figure out the solutions to our problems. Similar to how we would work in practice, having the skill to strategically use the internet to be of help to us is something we truly learned from this project.</p>
        <p>In addition, with the optionality of the design and layout for the final product, we were not able to fully polish the front-end components of the website due to time constraints, but still, we ensured that all the requirements were met by the website.</p>
