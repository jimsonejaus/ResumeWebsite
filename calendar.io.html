        <p>Calendar.io is a small scale UI/UX and usability study which aims to address one of the more difficult parts of online learning: scheduling tasks. With the freedom given during the online setup, students in the Ateneo finds it a lot harder to keep track of all their tasks and schedule them during their free time. Thus, the solution that our team proposed is to create a mobile solution which connects their Canvas assignment to our app, Calendar.io, and it will automatically schedule their tasks on their preferred time and it remind to do those tasks during the time scheduled for it. However, they can also wish to reschedule it as they please.</p>
        <p>For this output, however, we discussed our plans and ideas for this solution to our volunteer participants who gave their insights and suggestions to further improve it. We also showed them a really simple prototype to one of our functionalities and gauged its usability using the consistency of their responses, their speed, and their subjective assessment of the prototype using a usability questionnaire.</p>

        <h3 class="project-heading">Project Highlights</h3>
        <p>In this project, we were really able to understand the concept of designing our apps and websites with a major consideration for our users. From the very idea to the prototype, this project takes the human element as a major factor for changes or improvements to the website. Immersing myself in this type of study made me really value the role that design plays in creating the solutions we make as the developers. Though, we only did a small portion of what we would otherwise do for a more complex project, it certainly was able to teach us the basics of UI/UX research.</p>
